# Project Euler

The project aims to present the solutions (hopefully elegant ones) to the first 100 problems in [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net), as the rules forbid sharing the solutions to the further ones. All the solutions are written in Python on a mobile phone IDE.

This peculiar method of procrastination will be available as a repository if I can figure out how to use git and push to a remote repo. on a mobile phone.
